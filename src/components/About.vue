          Rwanda continues to make considerable improvements to its business
          environment and investment climate and being the first greenest
          destination in Africa. Rwanda is the most reformed country in the
          world and the second best destination for doing business in Africa
          according to the World Bank's 'Ease of doing business report' (2020).
          With such conducive business environment, commercial disputes are
          inevitable.

          Kigali International Arbitration Centre (KIAC) was established in 2010
          as an independent body to provide infrastructure for quality services
          in arbitration and other ADR mechanisms. Launched officially in May
          2012, KIAC started in April 2013 to administer cases under its
          arbitration rules after continuous sensitization cam- paign in Rwanda
          and abroad on the use of arbitration and KIAC standards Arbitration
          clauses. The KIAC Arbitration Rules (2012) are a modern set of
          arbitration rules, which provisions are consistent with interna-
          tional best practices. Currently KIAC registered more than 200 cases.

          the hot topics shaping the future of international Arbitration in one
